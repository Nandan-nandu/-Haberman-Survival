Content
It contains the three features and two classes

nodes - Positive Lymph Nodes

class 2 - patient survived less than 5 years

Lymph Node
Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped organs that act as filters along the lymph fluid channels. As lymph fluid leaves the breast and eventually goes back into the bloodstream, the lymph nodes try to catch and trap cancer cells before they reach other parts of the body. Having cancer cells in the lymph nodes under your arm suggests an increased risk of the cancer spreading.In our data it is axillary nodes detected(0â€“52)
